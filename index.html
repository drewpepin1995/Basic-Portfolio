            <p>My name is Drew Pepin, I'm from Rochester New Hampshire, and I'm an amateur coder. I spent 3 years at UNH studying statistics, but never finished my degree. 
            I spent my whole life playing hockey and continue to play to this day, even though the dream of making the NHL is dead. During my free time I like spending time
            with my friends and family, and love just about anything that involes competition. If there's a winner and a loser I'll participate, no questions asked. My goal
            is to work with my brother in next year or so, who is a web developer and is working on starting his own business. I chose to embark on this coding journey because 
            I think it's a skill that is worth while to learn, and the demand for it is so high and continues to grow.
